The distributed, shared L3 caches in Intel multicore processors are composed of slices (typically 1 slice per core), each assigned responsibility for a fraction of the address space. A high degree of interleaving consecutive cache lines across the slice provides the appearance of a single cache resource  shared by all cores. ***A family*** of undocumented hash functions is used to distribute addresses to slices, with different hash functions required for a different number of slices (So, for a specific system, since the # of slice is a constant, a specific hash function from the family of hash functions will be applied by Intel, I believe). In all systems studied to date, the hash consists of relativelt short (16 to 16384 elements) "base sequence" of slice numbers, which is repeated with ***binary permutation*** for consecutive blocks of memory. The specific binary permutation used is selected by XOR-reductions of different subsets of the **higher-order** address bits.

Here comes a nice history of rather recent Intel microarchitectures:

Since the release of quad-core Nehalem microarchitecture processors in 2009, all of Intel's mainstream Xeon processors habe supported an L3 cache shared by all cores on the chip. In Nehalem (4 core) and Westmere (6 core), the HW performance counter interface presents image of a monolithic L3 resource. By the time Intel reached 8 cores with Sandy Bridge in 2012, the BW and access rate required for an effective L3 cache could not be satisfied by a monolithic resource, and the L3 was explicitly split into 8 slices (1 per core), with each slice responsible for caching 1/8 of the total cache line addresses. To spread the accesses across the slices as uniformly as possible, ******each aligned block of 8 consecutive cache lines****** is assigned to a permutatişon of the 8 L3 slices using an undocumented hash function. L1 and L2 caches remain private to the cores, and ***only on an L2 cache miss*** does the processors have to compute the hash function to send the request to the **proper** L3 slice.

For Intel processors of the Xeon, the L3 cache is shared, distributed, and incl
