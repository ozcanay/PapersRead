Cache-based side channel attacks: In this attacks, the attacker forces contention on cache set the victim uses, in order to identify victim activity in these cache sets.

Until recently, these attacks have targeted the L1 cache and were, therefore, limited to a single core. This situation, however, changed with the publication of several attacks on the LLC. These attacks can be applied across cores since they are sharing the LLC. One of the commonly suggested mitigation techniques is page coloring, which partitions the memory of the computer such that process from different security domains never compete for the same parts of the cache. More specifically, virtual memory pages are partitioned into colors, such that memory addresses from differently colored pages map to disjoint cache sets. By allocating page frames to different domaşns from disjoint colors, cache accesses from different domains cannot conflict with each other in the cache.

To mount the attack, or to provide the defence, the attacker ***or defender*** needs to know the mapping of memory addresses to cache sets. 
In a *typical* set-associative cache design, **the cache-set index bits** of the physical address specify the index of the cache-set used for caching the contents of the address. The LLC design of recent Intel processors *******deviates from this typical design.*******, making it harder to determine the mapping. Specifically, Intel LLC is divided into multiple slices, each operating as a typical set-associative cache. Intel uses a proprietary hash function to map memory locations to cache slices. Without the knowledge of the hash function, attackers and defenders need to *probe* memory to find which memory locations map to each cache set. To facilitate this probe, there is a work in literature which recovers  the hash function for a specific processor, and ****demonstrates that the address bits that specify the cache-set index of a memory location are not considered as inputs to the hash function.**** 
--> As a consequence, recovering the mapping for a single cache-set index also provides mapping for all other cache set indices. <-- WHY?
Thus, instead of probing each of the 2048 cache-set indices of the Intel LLC, we only need to probe one, achieving a reduction of effort required.

The mapping also helps page coloring, where the system divides the memory into colors that do not map to the same cache sets. Without knowing the hash function, page coloring can only rely on the cache-set index bits, and because each virtual-memory page spans over 64 cache-lines, relying only on the cache-set index bits limits page coloring to only 32 different colors.

Here author made the assumption that pages are 4096 bytes (4KB): 64 cache-line of which each 64 bytes -> 64*64=4096 bytes.
